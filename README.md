# Malapit-Malayo-Detector-with-Arduino

This is a simple ultrasonic project that i stole from someone's video on Youtube
The only difference is, i just made an if-else statement that outputs: "Malapit", "Medyo abot", or "Malayo". It is in Filipino language.
"Near", "Kinda Near", or "far". 

The wiring diagram is attached in this repo
